# 42-TaskMaster

Basic task manager that reads from a config.json file and supervises a number of processes.
We were restricted to our language of choiceâ€™s standard library. Except for the config file parsing.

The script reads the tasks parameters from the json file, and executes some kind of user prompt to effectively manage these tasks.

The only argument needed is a config file. All info about making your own config file is in exampleconfig.json.
